# Student Information System
This is a simple Student Information System implemented in Java. 
The system allows users to:
1.Add student information (Name, Age, Roll Number, GPA).
2.Display a list of all students.
3.Search for a student by their roll number.
# Features:
1.Add Student: Prompts the user to input the student's details and adds the student to the system.
2.Display Students: Lists all the students currently in the system.
3.Search Student: Allows users to search for a student by roll number and display their details.
4.Exit: Exits the program.
# Code Enhancements:
*The code has been refactored to use the enhanced switch expression (rule switch) available in Java 12 and later. This improves the readability and maintainability of the code.
*Several fields, such as students, name, age, rollNumber, and gpa, were marked as final to improve immutability and ensure they aren't accidentally reassigned.
*The code is now more optimized and follows best practices for better performance and readability.
# Technologies Used:
Java 8 or later (enhanced switch syntax is supported from Java 12)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
